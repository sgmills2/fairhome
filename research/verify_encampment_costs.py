IMPORTANCE OF VERIFICATION:
===========================
The $20 million estimate is a significant component that could add substantial 
value to the AFairHome.org Cost-Impact analysis. However, for credibility:

1. The estimate should be verified against official city budget documents
2. If verified, it could be added as an additional quantified benefit
3. If unverified, it should remain listed as "estimated" or "potential" benefit
4. The source of the estimate should be clearly documented

Current Status: USER ESTIMATE - REQUIRES VERIFICATION
