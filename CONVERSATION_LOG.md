# FairHome Development Log

## Project Overview
A web application to help Chicago residents find affordable housing, built with React, TypeScript, and Mapbox. I typically use Windows on my Laptop and PC. Please default to Windows-based instructions & commands.

## Session History

### Initial Setup and Core Features (February 2024)
- Set up TypeScript monorepo with Yarn workspaces
- Created basic React application structure
- Implemented Mapbox integration
- Added Supabase backend integration
- Created basic listing display and filtering

### Map and UI Improvements
- Implemented clustering with Chicago flag colors (`#74C2E1` light blue, `#C3272B` red)
- Added cluster breakpoints:
  - 0-9 points: Light Blue
  - 10-24 points: Light Blue
  - 25-49 points: Red
  - 50+ points: Red
- Created responsive sidebar with listing details
- Added neighborhood search functionality
- Implemented basic filters (price, bedrooms, bathrooms)
- Added footer with auto-updating year

### Performance Optimizations
- Implemented debouncing for filter updates
- Added proper flexbox containment for scrolling
- Optimized marker rendering
- Added dynamic cluster radius based on zoom level

### Deployment Setup
- Configured GitHub Actions for automated deployment
- Set up custom domain (afairhome.org)
- Created comprehensive ROADMAP.md for feature planning

## Key Decisions

### Technical Choices
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: MUI Joy for consistent UI components
- **Map**: Mapbox for powerful mapping features
- **Backend**: Supabase for real-time database and authentication
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions for automated deployment

### UI/UX Decisions
- Used Chicago flag colors for visual identity
- Implemented clustering to handle large datasets
- Created responsive layout with sidebar
- Added progressive loading and performance optimizations

## Next Steps
1. Research and implement custom domain deployment best practices
2. Set up branch protection rules
3. Add deployment status monitoring
4. Begin work on features from ROADMAP.md

## Useful Commands

```

## Notes
- Keep Chicago residents' needs at the forefront of development decisions
- Focus on accessibility and usability
- Maintain performance with large datasets
- Regular testing on different devices and browsers
